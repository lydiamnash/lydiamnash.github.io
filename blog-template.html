<!--REFLECTION TIIIIMEEEE

How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
	
	I enjoyed working with Luis. I liked that we were able to bounce ideas off of each other.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

 	Yes, it is helpful to have the general design worked out first, then think about which html makes sense.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

	I like that we both wanted the wireframe to be simple.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

	I learned about using the section tag during this exercise.
