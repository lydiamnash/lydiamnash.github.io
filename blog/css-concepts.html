				<h1>Padding, Borders, and Margins - oh my!</h1>

				<p>In this second blog post, I am going to discuss the differences between padding, borders, and margins. These are three CSS properties that influence the positioning and look of your html elements. Padding is the space between your content and the border of the element. The border is the actual border of the element, which can be styled with colors, thickness, and solid/dashed. The margin is the space between the border of the element and adjacent html elements.</p>

				<p>When deciding whether to use the margin or padding property, it's important to keep in mind several things. First, padding is fixed and does not adjust based on the position of an adjacent element. On the other hand, margins can auto-collpase if there is an adjacent element that also has margin. Second, padding is part of the element -- which means that if you want to make an entire element clickable, the margin area will be included. So, a good time to use padding would be when you are designing a button -- you want there to be text in the button, but you may want there to be space around the text so the button is a little larger. This is when I would use padding.
