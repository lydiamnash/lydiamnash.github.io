      There are several advantages to using version control software. First, version control allows developers to create "save points" or "commits" while working on their project. These "save points" can be referred back to at any point if a developer accidentally introduces a bug. Another advantage to using version control is the ability to collaborate across developers/teams on projects. With version control, multiple people can work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each other's changes to the code. The version control system will track these changes, however, so that they can be merged properly.

        Git helps users keep track of changes at the time of each "commit," which is a "save point" initiated by the developer. Users can refer back to the code base at the time of each commit to see what changes were made over time and compare.

        Github allows users to share their projects with the world! Or just their teams :) This allows others to view code, copy, and/or collaborate.
