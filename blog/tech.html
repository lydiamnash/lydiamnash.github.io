				<h1>NoSQL Databases</h1>

				<p>This blog post shares some of the things I have learned about NoSQL databases and databases in general. First, a little history: before we had sophisticated databases like SQL and NoSQL, we stored data in flat files. An example of a flat file would a singular tab in Microsoft Excel. Then, in the 1970s, we developed relational database management systems (RDBMS) to capture more nuaned information and to standardize databse structures. That worked well, until recently. Since we're now in the age of capturing and analyzing big data, we have developed NoSQL databases because they don't have the scaling limitations of relational databases. <strong>In sum, relational databases provide high functionality and less performance, whereas non-relational databases provide low functinality and high performance</strong>.</p>
				<p>Here is more information about NoSQL DBs:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><strong>A difference between relational and non-relational databases is that relational databases only store structured data, whereas non-relational DBs store semi-structure and unstructured data.</strong> That is, after relational databases are set up, there is little to no flexibility in adjusting tables/fields. Non-relational databases have greater flexibility because there is no fiexed format. Unstructured data could be media files or blog posts.</li>
					<li><strong>There are no joins in nonrelational databases.</strong> Having joins reduces scalability, so there are non in NoSQL DBs.</li>
					<li><strong>You can't put constraints on fields.</strong> For example, you can't say field X must equal NULL under a certain condition.</li>
					<li><strong>You can query NoSQL databases (similar) to relational databses</strong>.</li>
