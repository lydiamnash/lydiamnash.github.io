## Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
To create a repository in github, go to your github user page and click on the "repository" tab. Then, click on the green button on the right side that says "new." After you have named your repository, selected your privacy settings, and added a license, then click "create respository." Once this is done, you can then clone it -- or make a copy of it -- to your machine by navigating to the repository and copying the "HTTPS clone URL" on the right side of the page. Then, open your terminal, navigate to the folder you'd like to place the copy of your repository and type in "git clone [paste-URL-here]."  

## Describe what open source means.
Open source means that the software's code is freely and openly available to be repurposed or modified without any copyright infringement.  	

## What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I think it's good. Greater access to code democratizes software.

## Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licenses are used to explain the scope to which software can be modified, distributed, etc. by a user. Licenses are extremely important and should be read by users so they understand what they can legally do with the software. 

## What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
I feel like I have a greater understanding of what open source software is! The buggest struggle was getting the git workflow down, even though that wasn't necessarily associated with this challenge...

## Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I read [this](https://blog.jcoglan.com/2010/08/15/what-i-mean-when-i-use-the-mit-license/) about MIT licenses.
